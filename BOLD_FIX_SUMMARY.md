# Bold Formatting Fix Summary

## Issue
Bold formatting using markdown `**text**` markers was not working in streaming output when using natural rhythm mode.

## Root Cause
In natural rhythm mode (and constant rate mode), the text is split into words before being processed. The bold detection logic in `process_chunk()` works character-by-character, but in queued modes, complete words are sent to `process_word()`, so the character-level bold detection never runs.

Example:
- Text: "**Coastal Areas**"
- Split into: ["**Coastal ", "Areas**"]
- Each word processed separately, so the `**` markers weren't detected as a pair

## Solution
Added bold marker detection to the `process_word()` method:

```python
def process_word(self, word: str) -> None:
    """Process a complete word (for queued mode)."""
    # Check for bold markers in the word
    if self.config.enable_bold and '**' in word:
        # Handle bold markers within the word
        parts = word.split('**')
        for i, part in enumerate(parts):
            if i > 0:
                # Toggle bold state at each ** boundary
                self.in_bold = not self.in_bold
            if part:  # Don't process empty parts
                self._process_word_part(part)
    else:
        # No bold markers, process normally
        self._process_word_part(word)
```

This processes each word looking for `**` markers and toggles the bold state appropriately.

## Testing
Created test script that confirms bold formatting now works correctly:
- Numbered lists (1., 2., etc.) are bold
- Text between `**` markers is bold
- Text after closing `**` is not bold

- `episodic/response_streaming.py`: Added bold detection to `process_word()` method
