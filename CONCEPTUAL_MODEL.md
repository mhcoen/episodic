# Episodic Conceptual Model

## Understanding How Episodic Works

### The Core Concept: One Continuous Conversation

Episodic maintains **one continuous conversation** stored in a SQLite database as a directed acyclic graph (DAG). This is different from traditional chat apps that have separate "chats" or "threads".

```
[Start] â†’ [User: Hi] â†’ [AI: Hello] â†’ [User: Tell me about X] â†’ [AI: X is...] â†’ ...
```

### Topics: Automatic Organization

Within this continuous conversation, Episodic automatically detects **topic changes** and segments the conversation:

```
Topic 1: Greetings
â”œâ”€â”€ User: Hi
â””â”€â”€ AI: Hello

Topic 2: Quantum Physics  
â”œâ”€â”€ User: Tell me about quantum physics
â”œâ”€â”€ AI: Quantum physics is...
â””â”€â”€ User: What about entanglement?

Topic 3: Recipe Ideas (ongoing)
â”œâ”€â”€ User: I need dinner ideas
â””â”€â”€ AI: Here are some recipes...
```

### The Mental Model

Think of Episodic like a continuous journal or notebook where:
- Everything is preserved in one flowing narrative
- Topics are like chapter markers that organize the content
- You can always go back and reference earlier conversations
- The context builds up over time

### Commands and Their Purpose

#### Simple Mode Commands (8 essentials):

1. **`/chat`** - Normal conversation mode
2. **`/muse`** - Web-enhanced conversation mode
3. **`/new`** - Start a fresh topic (like turning to a new page)
4. **`/save`** - Export current conversation to a markdown file
5. **`/load`** - Import a previous conversation back
6. **`/files`** - See your saved conversations
7. **`/help`** - Show available commands
8. **`/exit`** - Leave Episodic

### The `/new` Command

When you use `/new`, you're:
- Ending the current topic
- Adding a clear boundary in the conversation
- Starting fresh with a clean context
- NOT deleting anything - it's all still there

Example:
```
User: /new Project Planning
System: âœ“ Ended topic: Recipe Ideas
System: ðŸ†• Started new topic: Project Planning
```

### The `/save` Command

When you use `/save`, you're:
- Exporting a snapshot of your conversation to a markdown file
- Creating a portable record you can share or archive
- NOT affecting the database - it continues as normal
- Getting a descriptive filename generated by AI

Example:
```
User: /save
System: Generated filename: quantum-physics-discussion
System: âœ… Conversation saved to: exports/quantum-physics-discussion-1430.md
```

### Why This Design?

1. **No Lost Context**: Everything is preserved, you can always reference back
2. **Natural Flow**: Conversations flow naturally without artificial breaks
3. **Automatic Organization**: Topics provide structure without manual effort
4. **Export When Needed**: Save important conversations for sharing or archiving
5. **Clear Boundaries**: Use `/new` when you want a mental fresh start

### Tips for Simple Mode Users

- Use `/new` when switching between different projects or subjects
- Use `/save` after important conversations you want to keep
- Use `/muse` when you need current information from the web
- Don't worry about the database growing - Episodic handles compression automatically
- Your conversation history is valuable context that improves responses over time

### Advanced Features (in advanced mode)

- Navigate to any point in conversation history
- Manually manage topics and compression
- Search through all past conversations
- Fine-tune models and parameters
- Access 50+ specialized commands

Switch to advanced mode with `/advanced` when you're ready for more control.
