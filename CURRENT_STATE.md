# Current State - July 15, 2025

## Branch: bug/export

### Completed Work

1. **Markdown Export/Import Feature** (from previous session)
   - Added markdown export functionality (`/export` or `/ex`)
   - Added markdown import functionality (`/import` or `/im`)
   - Added file listing command (`/files` as primary, `/ls` as alias)
   - Changed help category from "save" to "markdown"

2. **Test Fixes**
   - Fixed 17 database tests (100% passing)
   - Removed deprecated close_connection() calls
   - Fixed mock configuration issues
   - Updated database context managers
   - Deleted 5 skipped test methods

3. **Export Bug Fix**
   - Fixed issue where exports only showed user messages
   - Root cause: Topics incorrectly end on user messages instead of assistant responses
   - Implemented workaround in get_nodes_for_topic() to include assistant response after topic end
   - Uses get_children() to find and append assistant response when topic ends on user message

### Current Issues

1. **Topic Boundary Detection**
   - Topics currently end at user messages (where change is detected)
   - Should end after assistant response for complete conversation pairs
   - Affects exports, compression, and topic statistics
   - Current (3,3) sliding window detection on user queries

2. **Remaining Test Failures**
   - Import path updates needed for refactored modules
   - Web search command tests need update (/websearch â†’ /web)
   - New markdown alias tests need to be added

### Database State
- Default location: ~/.episodic/episodic.db
- Contains mix of topics with correct and incorrect boundaries
- Topic ID 1 ("greetings") has only user messages due to boundary issue
- Most recent topic: "unix-command-ls" (ongoing)

### Recent Commits
```
b5d76af fix: include assistant messages in markdown export when topics end on user messages
28251cd fix: resolve export command errors
6a5dbbd Remove requirements_minimal.txt from repository
0ed10cd test: remove pointless markdown alias mock tests
85cde87 test: add remaining test fixes and markdown alias tests
```

### Todo Items
- [ ] Update import paths for refactored modules
- [ ] Update web search command tests from /websearch to /web
- [ ] Add tests for new markdown aliases
- [ ] Fix topic boundary detection to mark after assistant responses (major task)

### Command Aliases
- `/export` or `/ex` - Export topics to markdown
- `/import` or `/im` - Import markdown conversation
- `/files` or `/ls` - List markdown files

### API Key Security Issue (Resolved)
- User's OpenAI API key was exposed in .mcp.json
- User needs to revoke old key and clean git history
- New .mcp.json should be in .gitignore

### Next Steps
1. Consider implementing proper fix for topic boundary detection
2. Complete remaining test updates
3. Discuss alternative names for import/export (user expressed dislike)
4. Clean git history to remove exposed API key
