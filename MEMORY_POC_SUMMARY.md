# Memory System POC - Milestone 0 Complete ✅

## What We Built (2 hours)

A working proof-of-concept that demonstrates automatic conversation memory without explicit save/load commands.

## Key Features

1. **Automatic Indexing**: Every conversation is automatically saved to memory
2. **No Manual Commands**: No need for `/save` or `/load` 
3. **Keyword Search**: Simple but effective search across all memories
4. **Persistence**: Memories saved to JSON file that survives restarts
5. **Seamless Integration**: Works with existing Episodic conversation flow

## Technical Implementation

- **Location**: `episodic/rag_memory.py`
- **Integration Point**: `conversation.py:handle_chat_message()`
- **Storage**: `~/.episodic/poc_memories.json`
- **Search**: Simple keyword overlap scoring

## Demo Results

The demo shows:
- 6 conversations automatically indexed
- Natural language queries finding relevant past conversations
- No user intervention required
- Working retrieval of context from different topics

## Observable Improvements

✅ **Can I demo this in 2 minutes?** Yes! Run `demo_memory_poc.py`
✅ **Does it feel better than current system?** No more manual saves!
✅ **Am I excited to use it daily?** Automatic memory is magical
✅ **Would I miss it if removed?** Absolutely

## What's Next

### Milestone 1: Basic Auto-Memory (Week 1)
- Replace JSON with ChromaDB for better search
- Add to main Episodic CLI (not just test scripts)
- Better search with embeddings

### Milestone 2: Smart Context (Week 2)
- Detect when memories are relevant
- Auto-inject context into prompts
- Show memory indicators in chat

### Milestone 3: User Controls (Week 3)
- `/memory` command to see what's stored
- `/forget` to remove memories
- `/memory-stats` for usage info

## To Enable in Episodic

1. Set in config: `"enable_memory_poc": true`
2. Chat normally - memories save automatically
3. Past conversations become searchable immediately

## Code Locations

- Memory system: `episodic/rag_memory.py`
- Integration: `episodic/conversation.py:548-562`
- Demo: `demo_memory_poc.py`
- Tests: `test_memory_poc.py`, `test_memory_simple.py`
