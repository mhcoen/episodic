# Memory System Fixes

## Issue
Memory commands (`/memory`, `/forget`, `/memory-stats`) were incorrectly checking if RAG was enabled before executing, making them inaccessible when auto-context was disabled.

## Solution
Modified all memory commands to work independently of the RAG setting:

1. **Updated `episodic/commands/memory.py`**:
   - Removed RAG enabled checks from all memory commands
   - Memory viewing, searching, and management now always available
   - Added helpful indicators showing auto-context status
   - Added tips to enable auto-context when viewing memories

2. **Key Changes**:
   - `list_memories()` - Now shows memories regardless of RAG setting
   - `search_memories()` - Search always available
   - `show_memory()` - View memory details always available
   - `forget_command()` - Memory management always available
   - `memory_stats_command()` - Shows stats with auto-context status

3. **User Experience Improvements**:
   - Memory stats shows "Auto-context: ✓ Active" or "✗ Disabled"
   - When listing memories with RAG disabled, shows tip to enable
   - Clear separation between memory management and auto-enhancement

## Testing
- All memory command tests pass
- Commands work correctly with RAG both enabled and disabled
- User can manage memories independently of auto-context feature

## Documentation Updates
- Updated `/docs/memory-system.md` to clarify the distinction
- RAG setting only controls automatic context enhancement
- Memory commands always available for viewing and management
