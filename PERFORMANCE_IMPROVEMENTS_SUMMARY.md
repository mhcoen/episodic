# Performance Improvements Summary

This document summarizes the performance improvements made to the Episodic project.

## 1. Database Connection Pooling âœ…

**Status**: Already implemented in `episodic/db_connection.py`

### Features:
- Connection pool with configurable size (default: 5 connections)
- Connection age management (5-minute max age)
- WAL mode enabled for better concurrency
- Automatic connection validation and recreation
- Thread-safe implementation
- Can be disabled via `EPISODIC_DISABLE_POOL=true` for testing

### Benefits:
- Reduces connection overhead for frequent database operations
- Better performance under concurrent load
- Automatic handling of stale connections
- SQLite optimizations (WAL mode, query optimization)

### Usage:
```python
# Connections are automatically pooled when using get_connection()
with get_connection() as conn:
    # Your database operations
    pass

# Close pool on shutdown
from episodic.db_connection import close_pool
close_pool()
```

## 2. Async Web Search Implementation

**Status**: Created enhanced async version and patch for existing code

### Files Created:
1. `episodic/web_search_async.py` - Fully async implementation
2. `web_search_fix.patch` - Patch to fix the existing implementation

### Current Issue:
The existing `web_search.py` has a bug where the synchronous `search()` method tries to use `await` on line 620, which causes a syntax error. The search providers are properly async, but the manager's search method needs proper event loop handling.

### Solution Provided:

#### Option 1: Use the new AsyncWebSearchManager
```python
from episodic.web_search_async import get_async_web_search_manager

# For async contexts
manager = get_async_web_search_manager()
results = await manager.search_async("query")

# For sync contexts (creates event loop)
results = manager.search("query")
```

#### Option 2: Apply the patch to fix existing code
```bash
# Apply the patch to fix the existing web_search.py
patch -p1 < web_search_fix.patch
```

### Benefits:
- Non-blocking I/O for web searches
- Better performance when searching multiple providers
- Proper event loop management
- No blocking of the main thread

## 3. Additional Performance Recommendations

### Quick Wins (Not Yet Implemented):

1. **Add Database Indexes**
   ```sql
   CREATE INDEX idx_nodes_parent ON nodes(parent_id);
   CREATE INDEX idx_nodes_short_id ON nodes(short_id);
   CREATE INDEX idx_topics_end_node ON topics(end_node_id);
   ```

2. **Implement Result Pagination**
   - Add limit/offset to `get_all_nodes()`
   - Implement cursor-based pagination for large conversations

3. **Add Response Caching**
   ```python
   from functools import lru_cache
   
   @lru_cache(maxsize=128)
   def get_cached_node(node_id):
       return get_node(node_id)
   ```

4. **Lazy Loading for Ancestry**
   - Only load what's needed for context
   - Implement depth limits consistently

## Performance Testing

To verify the improvements:

```python
# Test connection pooling
import time
from episodic.db_connection import get_connection

# Without pooling (EPISODIC_DISABLE_POOL=true)
start = time.time()
for _ in range(100):
    with get_connection() as conn:
        conn.execute("SELECT 1")
print(f"Without pooling: {time.time() - start:.2f}s")

# With pooling (default)
start = time.time()
for _ in range(100):
    with get_connection() as conn:
        conn.execute("SELECT 1")
print(f"With pooling: {time.time() - start:.2f}s")
```

## Summary

1. **Connection Pooling**: âœ… Already implemented and working
2. **Async Web Search**: âœ… Solution provided (needs integration)
3. **Additional Optimizations**: ðŸ“‹ Recommendations provided

The connection pooling implementation is already in place and provides significant performance benefits for database operations. The async web search needs a small fix to work properly, and I've provided both a complete async implementation and a patch for the existing code.
