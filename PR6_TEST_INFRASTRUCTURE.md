# PR #6: Test Infrastructure

## Summary
Reorganized and enhanced the test infrastructure to provide better test organization, reusable fixtures, and comprehensive test coverage for the Episodic codebase.

## Changes Made

### Test Organization
Created a clear hierarchical structure for tests:

```
tests/
├── conftest.py              # Pytest configuration and shared fixtures
├── run_all_tests.py         # Enhanced test runner with categories
├── fixtures/                # Reusable test fixtures
│   ├── __init__.py
│   ├── conversations.py     # Test conversation data
│   └── test_utils.py        # Common test utilities
├── unit/                    # Unit tests
│   ├── __init__.py
│   ├── topics/              # Topic-related unit tests
│   │   ├── __init__.py
│   │   └── test_topic_detection.py
│   └── commands/            # Command-related unit tests
│       ├── __init__.py
│       └── test_unified_commands.py
└── integration/             # Integration tests
    ├── __init__.py
    ├── test_topic_detection_flow.py
    └── topics/              # Topic integration tests
        └── (moved test files)
```

### Test Fixtures
Created comprehensive test fixtures in `fixtures/` directory:

1. **conversations.py**: Pre-defined test conversations
   - `THREE_TOPICS_CONVERSATION` - Conversation with 3 distinct topics
   - `GRADUAL_DRIFT_CONVERSATION` - Conversation with gradual topic drift
   - `SINGLE_TOPIC_CONVERSATION` - Single topic conversation
   - Helper functions for creating test nodes and conversations

2. **test_utils.py**: Common test utilities
   - `temp_database()` - Context manager for temporary test databases
   - `mock_llm_response()` - Mock LLM responses
   - `isolated_config()` - Isolated configuration for testing
   - `capture_cli_output()` - Capture CLI output for assertions
   - Various helper functions for test setup

### New Test Modules

1. **test_topic_detection.py**: Unit tests for topic detection
   - Sliding window detector tests
   - Topic boundary detection tests
   - Configuration parameter tests
   - Drift calculation tests

2. **test_unified_commands.py**: Unit tests for unified commands
   - Topics command with all subactions
   - Compression command with all subactions
   - Settings command with all subactions
   - Command registry functionality
   - Backward compatibility tests

3. **test_topic_detection_flow.py**: Integration tests
   - Complete topic detection flow
   - Manual topic indexing
   - Topic renaming flow
   - Topic compression integration
   - Edge case handling

### Enhanced Test Runner
Created `run_all_tests.py` with multiple test categories:
- `all` - Run all tests
- `unit` - Run only unit tests
- `integration` - Run only integration tests
- `quick` - Run stable, fast tests
- `topics` - Run topic-related tests
- `commands` - Run command-related tests
- `coverage` - Run with coverage reporting

### Pytest Support
Added `conftest.py` for pytest compatibility:
- Shared fixtures available to all tests
- Custom markers for test categorization
- Automatic marker assignment based on test location

## Benefits

1. **Better Organization**: Tests clearly separated by type and functionality
2. **Reusable Fixtures**: Common test data and utilities easily shared
3. **Comprehensive Coverage**: New tests for unified commands and topic detection
4. **Flexible Running**: Can run specific test categories as needed
5. **Easy Maintenance**: Clear structure makes it easy to add new tests
6. **CI/CD Ready**: Structured for integration with continuous integration

## Usage Examples

```bash
# Run all tests
python tests/run_all_tests.py all

# Run only unit tests
python tests/run_all_tests.py unit

# Run quick tests (stable subset)
python tests/run_all_tests.py quick

# Run with coverage
python tests/run_all_tests.py coverage

# Run specific test file
python -m unittest tests.unit.topics.test_topic_detection -v

# Run with pytest (if installed)
pytest tests/ -v
pytest tests/unit -m "not slow"
pytest tests/integration -k "topic"
```

## Migration Notes

- Test files from `tests/scripts/` have been reorganized into appropriate unit/integration directories
- Existing tests remain functional
- No changes required to existing test code
- All imports updated to use new fixture modules

## Next Steps

With a solid test infrastructure in place, we can:
1. Add more comprehensive test coverage
2. Set up continuous integration
3. Add performance benchmarks
4. Create test documentation

This infrastructure provides a strong foundation for maintaining code quality as the project evolves.
