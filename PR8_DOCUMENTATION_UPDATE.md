## Key Documentation Improvements

1. **Accuracy**: All documentation now reflects actual code structure
2. **Completeness**: Covers architecture, decisions, and configuration
3. **Clarity**: Better organization and clearer explanations
4. **Examples**: Updated with current command syntax
5. **Navigation**: Clear links between related documents

## Documentation Standards Established

1. **Command Examples**: Always show current syntax
2. **Code Locations**: Use actual file paths from current structure
3. **Version Information**: Note when features were added/changed
4. **Deprecation Notices**: Clear migration paths for old features
5. **Architecture Diagrams**: Visual representation where helpful

## Future Documentation Needs

1. **API Documentation**: If REST API is added
2. **Plugin Development**: When plugin system is implemented
3. **Migration Guides**: For major version updates
4. **Tutorial Series**: Step-by-step guides for common tasks
5. **Troubleshooting Guide**: Common issues and solutions

## Benefits

- New developers can understand the system quickly
- Architectural decisions are documented for future reference
- Configuration options are clearly explained
- Migration path from old to new features is clear
- Consistent documentation style throughout

## Next Steps

With documentation updated, the codebase cleanup is complete. Future development can build on this solid foundation with confidence that the documentation accurately represents the system.
