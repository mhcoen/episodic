# Tab Completion Implementation State

## Date: 2025-01-16

### What Was Implemented

1. **Created `cli_completer.py`** with the `EpisodicCompleter` class that provides:
   - Command completion with aliases support
   - Context-aware parameter completion
   - Model name completion for `/model` command
   - File path completion for `/import`, `/export`, `/index`, `/script`
   - Boolean value completion for config parameters
   - Subcommand completion for unified commands (`/topics`, `/compression`)
   - Smart suggestions (e.g., export filename based on current topic)

2. **Key Features**:
   - Only activates for slash commands (`/`)
   - Aliases are preserved (not expanded) as requested
   - File completion filters by type (only `.md` for import)
   - Export suggests filename based on current topic
   - Model names show provider info
   - Commands show descriptions in metadata

### What Still Needs to Be Done

1. **Integration into main CLI loop** in `cli.py` or `cli_main.py`:
   - Replace `input()` with `prompt()` from prompt_toolkit
   - Add the completer instance
   - Make it configurable via `enable_tab_completion` setting

2. **Testing**:
   - Need to test the completer in the actual CLI environment
   - Verify all completion contexts work correctly

3. **Additional completions to consider**:
   - Topic names for `/topics rename` 
   - Document IDs for `/docs remove`
   - Available styles for `/style` command
   - Web search providers for `/web provider`

### Next Steps

1. Integrate the completer into the main CLI loop
2. Add configuration option
3. Test thoroughly
4. Add any missing completion contexts

### Code Location

- Completer implementation: `/Users/mhcoen/proj/episodic/episodic/cli_completer.py`
- Integration point: `/Users/mhcoen/proj/episodic/episodic/cli_main.py` or `cli.py`

### Notes

- Using prompt_toolkit as requested
- Completer leverages existing command registry for self-updating behavior
- File path completion handles `~` expansion properly
- Model completion uses the existing model discovery functions
