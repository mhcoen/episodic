# Streaming Fix Summary

## Issues Fixed

1. **Double Printing Bug**: Text was being printed twice during streaming - once by the chunk processing logic and once by the line wrapping logic.
2. **No Constant-Rate Streaming**: Streaming happened immediately as chunks arrived from the LLM, which could be jarring.

## Changes Made

### 1. Fixed Double Printing (conversation.py)
- Removed the complex line buffering and wrapping logic in immediate streaming mode
- Now prints chunks directly as they arrive without buffering
- Added a newline after streaming completes

### 2. Added Constant-Rate Streaming
- Added configuration options:
  - `stream_rate`: Words per second (default: 15, range: 1-100)
  - `stream_constant_rate`: Enable/disable constant-rate mode (default: False)
- When enabled, text streams at a steady pace using a word queue and timer thread
- Words are buffered and printed at the configured rate

### 3. Updated Configuration System
- Added new streaming parameters to default config in `config.py`
- Added handlers in `/set` command for both new parameters
- Updated `/set` display to show current streaming configuration

## Usage

### View current streaming settings:
```
/set
```

### Enable constant-rate streaming:
```
/set stream_constant_rate on
/set stream_rate 10
```

### Disable constant-rate streaming:
```
/set stream_constant_rate off
```

### Toggle streaming on/off entirely:
```
/set stream off  # Disable all streaming
/set stream on   # Re-enable streaming
```

## Testing

Run the test script to verify the fixes:
```bash
python test_streaming_fix.py
```

For manual testing:
1. Start episodic: `python -m episodic`
2. Enable constant-rate: `/set stream_constant_rate on`
3. Set rate: `/set stream_rate 5`
4. Send a message and observe the streaming behavior
5. Compare with immediate streaming: `/set stream_constant_rate off`
