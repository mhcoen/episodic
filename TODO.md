# Episodic Project TODO

## Completed âœ…

### Topic Detection & Management
- [x] **Implement LLM-based topic detection** - Uses ollama/llama3 for efficient detection
- [x] **Add topic extraction function** - `extract_topic_ollama()` implemented
- [x] **Database schema** - Topics table with name, start/end nodes, confidence
- [x] **Implement `/topics` command** - Shows topics with ranges and node counts
- [x] **Topic storage/retrieval** - Full CRUD operations for topics
- [x] **Optional topic display** - `/set show_topics true` shows topic evolution
- [x] **Fix topic naming** - Topics named based on content, not trigger message
- [x] **Topic detection prompt optimization** - Simplified for ollama/llama3 compatibility

### Compression System
- [x] **Async background compression** - Thread-based worker with priority queue
- [x] **Auto-compression on topic change** - Topics compressed when closed
- [x] **Compression statistics** - `/compression-stats` command
- [x] **Configurable compression** - Model, min nodes, notifications via `/set`

### UI/UX Improvements
- [x] **Color scheme adaptation** - Supports light/dark terminals
- [x] **Colored help display** - Commands and descriptions with proper formatting
- [x] **Benchmark system** - Performance tracking with `/benchmark` command
- [x] **Summary command** - `/summary [N|all]` for conversation summaries
- [x] **Benchmark display after commands** - Shows benchmarks after commands when enabled

## In Progress ðŸš§

### Topic Management Enhancements
- [ ] **Running topic guess** - Update tentative topic names periodically
- [ ] **Fix first topic creation** - Initial topic not always created properly

## Pending ðŸ“‹

### High Priority
- [ ] **Manual compression trigger** - `/compress topic-name` command
- [ ] **Topic-based navigation** - Jump to specific topics in history

### Medium Priority  
- [ ] **Improve drift accuracy** - Current embedding approach shows high drift for similar sentences
- [ ] **Async drift processing** - Calculate drift in background to reduce delays

### Low Priority
- [ ] **Move debug messages** - Topic detection debug should appear after LLM response
- [ ] **Topic refinement UI** - Allow manual topic name editing
- [ ] **Export topics** - Export topic summaries to markdown

## Technical Debt ðŸ”§
- [ ] **Reduce drift calculation overhead** - Consider faster embedding model
- [ ] **Better embedding cache strategy** - Optimize to reduce redundant calculations
- [ ] **Clean up test files** - Remove old test scripts and consolidate

## Notes
- Topic detection uses configurable model (default: ollama/llama3)
- Compression happens automatically when topics close
- Current active topic shows as "ongoing-discussion" until closed
- Running topic guess is configurable via `/set running_topic_guess`
