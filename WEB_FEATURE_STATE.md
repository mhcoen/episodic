# Web Feature Current State - 2025-07-04

## Completed Features

### 1. Web Search Providers
- Implemented DuckDuckGo, Searx, Google, and Bing providers
- Configurable via `web_search_provider` setting
- Working search with rate limiting and caching

### 2. Web Content Extraction
- Created `web_extract.py` with content extraction from search results
- Handles SSL issues for weather sites
- Extracts temperature, conditions, and other structured data
- Uses `--extract` flag or `web_search_extract_content` setting

### 3. Web Synthesis (Perplexity-like)
- Created `web_synthesis.py` for LLM-powered answer synthesis
- Combines multiple search results into coherent answers
- Uses `--synthesize` flag or `web_search_synthesize` setting
- Formats output with markdown headers and bullet lists

### 4. Unified Text Formatter
- Created `text_formatter.py` for consistent text display
- Supports:
  - Bold text before colons in bullet lists: `**Key**: Value`
  - Colored values after colons (should use system color)
  - Word wrapping with formatting preservation
  - Special #### header formatting with underlines
  - StreamingFormatter class for future integration

## Resolved Issues

### ✅ Color Display Problem (RESOLVED)
- **Issue**: Colors were not displaying correctly in non-TTY environments
- **Root Cause**: 
  - The color functions were returning strings, not objects
  - Click/typer was stripping ANSI codes in non-TTY environments
- **Solution**:
  - Created `color_utils.py` with color forcing for non-TTY environments
  - Replaced `typer.secho` with `secho_color` that forces color output
  - Fixed string conversion (using `isinstance(color, str)` instead of `hasattr`)
  - Now outputs ANSI color codes even when stdout is not a TTY

The formatter now correctly displays:
- Bold labels before colons in bullet lists
- Bright cyan values after colons (in dark mode)
- Properly colored headers with underlines

## Test Commands

```bash
# Test web search with extraction
/ws what is the weather in madison, wi? --extract

# Test web search with synthesis (shows color issue)
/ws what time is it in brazil right now --synthesize

# Enable synthesis by default
/set web_search_synthesize true

# Check color configuration
/set color_mode
```

## Files Modified

1. `episodic/web_search.py` - Added search providers
2. `episodic/web_extract.py` - New file for content extraction
3. `episodic/web_synthesis.py` - New file for answer synthesis
4. `episodic/text_formatter.py` - New file for unified text formatting
