# Advanced Topic Detection Approaches - Evaluation Results

## Summary

We implemented and evaluated two advanced approaches suggested for real-time topic segmentation:

1. **Online Bayesian Change Point Detection (BOCPD)**
2. **Incremental Supervised Models** (using pre-trained transformers)

## Results Overview

### 1. Bayesian Change Point Detection

**Implementation**: Uses BOCPD on semantic drift scores between consecutive messages.

#### SuperDialseg Performance (100 dialogues)
- **F1 Score**: 0.441
- **Precision**: 0.497
- **Recall**: 0.457
- **F1 (w=3)**: 0.617
- **WindowDiff**: 0.429

#### DialSeg711 Performance (100 dialogues)
- **F1 Score**: 0.416
- **Precision**: 0.330
- **Recall**: 0.608
- **F1 (w=3)**: 0.560
- **WindowDiff**: 0.465

### 2. Supervised Window Detector

**Implementation**: Uses Sentence-BERT embeddings in a sliding window approach.

#### SuperDialseg Performance (50 dialogues)
- **F1 Score**: ~0.400 (initial test)
- **Precision**: High (1.000 on sample)
- **Recall**: Lower (0.250 on sample)
- Shows promise but needs threshold tuning

## Comparison with Original Approaches

| Approach | SuperDialseg F1 | DialSeg711 F1 | Speed | Real-time |
|----------|----------------|---------------|--------|-----------|
| Sliding Window (optimized) | 0.562 | 0.372 | Fast | Yes |
| Bayesian BOCPD | 0.441 | 0.416 | Fast | Yes |
| Supervised (BERT) | ~0.400* | TBD | Slower | Yes |
| Keywords | ~0.000 | 0.158 | Very Fast | Yes |

*Limited testing

## Key Findings

### 1. Bayesian Approach
- **Pros**:
  - Principled probabilistic framework
  - Good balance of precision/recall
  - Works well across both datasets
  - Real-time capable
- **Cons**:
  - Slightly lower F1 than optimized sliding window
  - Requires tuning hazard parameter

### 2. Supervised Approach
- **Pros**:
  - Uses powerful pre-trained representations
  - High precision potential
  - Could be fine-tuned on SuperDialseg
- **Cons**:
  - Requires downloading models (~50-500MB)
  - Slower than embedding-based approaches
  - Still needs threshold optimization

### 3. Dataset Differences
- **SuperDialseg**: Clear topic boundaries, lower optimal thresholds
- **DialSeg711**: More subtle transitions, benefits from Bayesian approach

## Recommendations

1. **For Production Use**:
   - Sliding Window (threshold=0.3) for SuperDialseg-like data
   - Bayesian BOCPD for more general/unknown data
   - Ensemble of multiple approaches for best results

2. **For Further Research**:
   - Fine-tune BERT on SuperDialseg training data
   - Explore online learning to adapt thresholds
   - Combine Bayesian framework with supervised embeddings

3. **Architecture Considerations**:
   - All approaches support real-time detection
   - Bayesian provides uncertainty estimates
   - Supervised models offer path to continuous improvement

## Code Implementation

All approaches are implemented in:
- `evaluation/bayesian_detector.py` - Bayesian changepoint detection
- `evaluation/supervised_detector.py` - Transformer-based detection
- `evaluation/detector_adapters.py` - Integration framework

To reproduce:
```bash
# Bayesian
python evaluation/run_evaluation.py /path/to/dataset --detector bayesian --threshold 0.25

# Supervised
python evaluation/run_evaluation.py /path/to/dataset --detector supervised --threshold 0.5
```

## Conclusion

The advanced approaches show competitive performance while maintaining real-time capabilities. The Bayesian approach offers a good balance and theoretical foundation, while supervised models provide a path for future improvements through fine-tuning. The original sliding window approach remains highly competitive when properly tuned.
