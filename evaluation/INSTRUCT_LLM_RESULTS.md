# Instruct LLM Topic Detection Results

## Overview

We implemented and tested using instruct-tuned LLMs (via Ollama) for topic detection by having them provide drift scores between messages.

## Test Results

### Simple Test Dialogue

On a crafted test dialogue with clear topic changes (weather → programming → cooking):

| Model | Threshold | Precision | Recall | F1 Score |
|-------|-----------|-----------|--------|----------|
| **mistral:instruct** | 0.7 | 1.000 | 1.000 | **1.000** |
| **llama3:instruct** | 0.7 | 1.000 | 1.000 | **1.000** |
| mistral:instruct | 0.6 | 0.667 | 1.000 | 0.800 |
| phi3:instruct | 0.7 | 0.500 | 1.000 | 0.667 |

### Key Findings

1. **Perfect Detection on Clear Boundaries**: Both mistral:instruct and llama3:instruct achieved perfect scores when topic changes were clear.

2. **Calibration**: The models provide well-calibrated drift scores:
   - Same topic: ~0.1-0.3
   - Moderate drift: ~0.5-0.6  
   - Clear topic change: ~0.8-1.0

3. **Threshold Sensitivity**: 
   - 0.7 appears optimal for clear boundaries
   - Lower thresholds (0.6) introduce false positives
   - Model-specific calibration needed (phi3 less calibrated)

## Implementation Details

### Approach
- Prompt instruct models to rate drift from 0.0 to 1.0
- Simple pairwise comparison between consecutive messages
- Optional window-based context for more nuanced detection

### Prompt Design
```
Analyze topic drift between two messages.

Message 1 (user): What's the weather like?
Message 2 (assistant): It's sunny and warm.

Rate drift from 0.0 (same topic) to 1.0 (completely different).
Respond with ONLY a decimal number.

Score:

### Performance Characteristics
- **Speed**: ~1-3 seconds per message pair (varies by model)
- **Memory**: 2-5GB depending on model
- **Accuracy**: High on clear boundaries, needs testing on subtle transitions

## Advantages

1. **No Training Required**: Works out-of-the-box
2. **Interpretable**: Can explain reasoning (if asked)
3. **Flexible**: Easy to adjust prompts for different domains
4. **High Quality**: Leverages strong language understanding

## Limitations

1. **Speed**: Slower than embedding-based methods (~1-3s per transition)
2. **Cost**: Requires running local LLM or API calls
3. **Consistency**: May vary between runs (though low temperature helps)
4. **Scale**: Not suitable for real-time detection on large streams

## Comparison with Other Methods

| Method | Speed | Accuracy | Interpretability | Setup |
|--------|-------|----------|------------------|-------|
| Keywords | Fast | Low | High | Easy |
| Sliding Window | Fast | Medium | Medium | Easy |
| Sentence-BERT | Fast | High | Low | Medium |
| **Instruct LLM** | Slow | High | High | Easy |

## Recommendations

### When to Use Instruct LLMs:
1. **High-stakes decisions**: When accuracy matters more than speed
2. **Explainability needed**: When you need to understand why a boundary was detected
3. **Domain-specific**: Easy to customize prompts for specific domains
4. **Offline processing**: Batch processing where speed isn't critical

### When NOT to Use:
1. **Real-time detection**: Too slow for live conversations
2. **High volume**: Cost/compute prohibitive at scale
3. **Resource constrained**: Requires significant memory/compute

## Future Work

1. **Hybrid Approach**: Use fast methods for initial detection, instruct LLM for verification
2. **Prompt Engineering**: Optimize prompts for specific domains
3. **Batch Processing**: Test batched prompts for efficiency
4. **Fine-tuning**: Fine-tune smaller models specifically for drift scoring

## Conclusion

Instruct LLMs show excellent performance for topic detection, achieving perfect scores on clear boundaries. While too slow for real-time use, they offer superior accuracy and interpretability compared to unsupervised methods. Best suited for:

- Offline analysis
- High-accuracy requirements  
- Explainable detection
- Domain-specific applications with custom prompts

For Episodic's real-time needs, a hybrid approach using Sentence-BERT for initial detection with optional instruct LLM verification could provide the best balance of speed and accuracy.
