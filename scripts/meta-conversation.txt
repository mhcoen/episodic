# Meta-conversation testing
# Tests discussion about the conversation itself and the system

I want to test your topic detection
Are you detecting topic changes properly?
How confident are you in your assessments?
What makes you decide to mark something as a topic change?

Now let's switch to completely different subjects
Tell me about space exploration
What's the latest Mars mission news?

Back to discussing the system again
How does your topic detection algorithm work?
Is it based on semantic similarity?
Do you think it's accurate?

Let's try talking about food now
What's your favorite cuisine?
How do you make a good pizza?
