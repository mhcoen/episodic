# Async Compression Test Script
# This script tests the automatic background compression system
# Load with: /script test-async-compression.txt

# First, enable notifications and debug mode to see what's happening
/set debug true
/set show_compression_notifications true
/set auto_compress_topics true

# Check initial compression stats
/compression-stats
/compression-queue

# Start first topic: Quantum Computing
Tell me about quantum computing
What are qubits and how do they work?
Can you explain superposition in simple terms?
What's the difference between quantum and classical computing?
How close are we to practical quantum computers?
What are the main challenges in building quantum computers?

# Change topic - this should trigger compression of quantum computing topic
Now let's talk about Italian cooking instead
What makes authentic Italian pasta different?
Can you share a simple carbonara recipe?
What are the key ingredients in Italian cooking?
Tell me about different types of Italian pasta shapes
What's the proper way to cook al dente pasta?

# Change topic again - this should trigger compression of Italian cooking topic  
I'd like to learn about machine learning now
What's the difference between supervised and unsupervised learning?
Can you explain what a neural network is?
How does backpropagation work?
What are some common ML algorithms for beginners?
What's the difference between AI and machine learning?

# Change topic once more - this should trigger compression of ML topic
Let's discuss climate change
What are the main causes of climate change?
How do greenhouse gases work?
What can individuals do to help?
What are the predicted impacts of climate change?
How do scientists measure global temperature changes?

# Check the compression queue and stats
/compression-queue
/compression-stats

# List recent nodes to see compressed topics
/last 30

# Final topic to ensure previous compressions complete
Tell me about the history of the internet
When was the internet invented?
Who were the key people involved?
What was ARPANET?

# Give compressions time to complete, then check final results

# Disable debug mode
/set debug false
/set show_compression_notifications false

# Summary message
/echo Test complete! Check the compressed nodes above marked with [Compressed Topic: ...]. You should see compressions for quantum-computing, italian-cooking, and machine-learning topics.
