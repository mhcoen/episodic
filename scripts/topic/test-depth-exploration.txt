# Start general
What is machine learning?

# Get more specific
How do neural networks work?

# Deeper
Can you explain backpropagation mathematically?

# Even more specific
What's the derivative of the sigmoid activation function?

# Related but different angle
How does batch normalization help?

# Practical application
How do I implement a neural network in PyTorch?

# Debugging specific issues
Why is my model overfitting?

# Very specific technical detail
What's the difference between Adam and SGD optimizers?

# Architecture specific
How many layers should my CNN have?

# Extremely specific
What kernel size works best for medical image segmentation?

# Should be 1 topic: machine-learning or neural-networks
