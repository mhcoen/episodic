# Episodic Development Session - 2025-06-30

## Session Overview
Fixed multiple critical issues with topic detection and boundaries, resulting in properly segmented conversation topics.

## Issues Addressed

### 1. Topic Message Count Showing 0 for Ongoing Topics
**Problem**: Topics without an end_node_id showed 0 messages in `/topics` command.

**Solution**: Modified `count_nodes_in_topic()` in `topics.py` to handle ongoing topics:
```python
if not topic_end_id:
    # For ongoing topics, count from start_node to current head
    from episodic.db import get_head
    current_head = get_head()
    if not current_head:
        return 0
    topic_end_id = current_head
```

### 2. Excessive Topic Creation
**Problem**: Topics were being created every 2 messages instead of following proper thresholds.

**Root Cause**: Configuration had `min_messages_before_topic_change` set to 2 instead of 8.

**Solution**: Updated configuration:
```python
config.set('min_messages_before_topic_change', 8)
```

### 3. Topic Boundary Assignment Bug
**Problem**: Topic boundaries were set at the detection point (e.g., message N) rather than where the topic actually changed (e.g., message N-3).

**Example**:
- User asks about Italian pasta at node 0c (actual topic change)
- System detects change at node 0g (4 messages later)
- Cooking messages 0c-0f incorrectly assigned to "space-exploration"

**Solution**: Created `topic_boundary_analyzer.py` that:
- Analyzes conversation history when topic change detected
- Finds where the topic actually transitioned
- Sets boundaries at the correct positions
- Supports both LLM-based and heuristic analysis

**Configuration**:
- `analyze_topic_boundaries` (default: True)
- `use_llm_boundary_analysis` (default: True)

### 4. Dynamic Threshold Regression
**Problem**: June 27 change removed dynamic thresholds, breaking three-topics-test.txt expectations.

**Original Behavior** (restored):
- First 2 topics: Use min_messages/2 threshold (4 when min=8)
- Subsequent topics: Use full threshold (8)

**Solution**: Restored dynamic threshold logic in `topics.py`:
```python
if total_topics <= 2:
    # For the first two topics, use half the threshold (min 4)
    effective_min = max(4, min_messages_before_change // 2)
else:
    # For subsequent topics, use the full threshold
    effective_min = min_messages_before_change
```

## Final Result

With all fixes applied, conversations now properly segment into logical topics:

**Before** (7 fragmented topics):
- mars-rover (8 msgs)
- space-exploration (6 msgs, includes cooking!)
- pasta-cooking (4 msgs, missing content)
- neural-networks (4 msgs)
- machine-learning (4 msgs)
- neural-networks (6 msgs, duplicate)
- deep-learning (6 msgs)

**After** (2-3 clean topics as expected):
- Mars/Space exploration (10 messages)
- Italian cooking (10 messages)
- Machine learning/Neural networks (18 messages)

## Files Modified

### Core Changes
1. `/episodic/topics.py` - Fixed message counting and restored dynamic thresholds
2. `/episodic/topic_boundary_analyzer.py` - New module for accurate boundary detection
3. `/episodic/conversation.py` - Integrated boundary analyzer
4. `/episodic/config.py` - Updated default configurations

### Documentation
1. `/CLAUDE.md` - Updated with session notes
2. `/docs/topic-boundary-analysis.md` - New documentation for boundary analysis feature
3. `/topic_detection_fix_analysis.md` - Detailed analysis of the issues and fixes

### Tests
1. `/scripts/test_boundary_analysis.py` - Tests for boundary analyzer
2. `/scripts/test-boundary-fix.txt` - Integration test script
3. Various diagnostic scripts created during debugging

## Configuration Recommendations

For optimal topic detection:

```bash
# Ensure proper threshold
/set min_messages_before_topic_change 8

# If hybrid detection causes issues
/set use_hybrid_topic_detection false

# Or adjust hybrid weights for less sensitivity
/set hybrid_topic_weights {"semantic_drift": 0.3, "keyword_explicit": 0.4, "keyword_domain": 0.2, "message_gap": 0.05, "conversation_flow": 0.05}
/set hybrid_topic_threshold 0.7
```

## Next Steps

1. Monitor topic detection accuracy with the fixes in place
2. Consider implementing topic merging for duplicate names
3. Fine-tune hybrid detection weights based on usage patterns
4. Add more comprehensive tests for edge cases

## Key Learnings

1. Topic detection timing is critical - detection lag causes misaligned boundaries
2. Dynamic thresholds are important for natural conversation flow
3. Configuration values have major impact on user experience
4. Retroactive boundary analysis significantly improves accuracy
5. Test scripts should be kept in sync with code behavior changes
