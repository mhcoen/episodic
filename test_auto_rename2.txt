Training deep learning models effectively involves following several best 
practices to improve performance and convergence. Here are some key best 
practices for training deep learning models:

1. Data Preprocessing:
- Normalize input data to have zero mean and unit variance.
- Perform data augmentation

   Full prompt:
You are a topic-shift detection assistant.
You will receive the last n user messages and the current user message.
Your task: deduce whether the current message starts a new topic.

Preceding context:
- User: What are some best practices for training deep learning models?
- User: How do transformers differ from traditional RNNs?
- User: What's the purpose of dropout in neural networks?
- User: Tell me about convolutional neural networks
- User: What are some common activation functions and when to use them?

New message:
Can you explain gradient descent optimization?

Step 1. Classify intent as exactly one of:
- JUST_COMMENT: Brief acknowledgment, reaction, or filler that doesn't advance conversation
- DEVELOP_TOPIC: Continuing or expanding on the current topic
- INTRODUCE_TOPIC: Starting a conversation or first substantial message
- CHANGE_TOPIC: Shifting to a completely different subject

Step 2. Determine if this is a topic shift:
- INTRODUCE_TOPIC ‚Üí YES (starting fresh)
- CHANGE_TOPIC ‚Üí YES (new subject)
- DEVELOP_TOPIC ‚Üí NO (same topic)
- JUST_COMMENT ‚Üí NO (not substantial)

Examples:
- "Tell me more" ‚Üí DEVELOP_TOPIC ‚Üí NO
- "What about its moons?" (after Mars discussion) ‚Üí DEVELOP_TOPIC ‚Üí NO
- "How do I cook pasta?" (after Mars discussion) ‚Üí CHANGE_TOPIC ‚Üí YES
- "Thanks!" ‚Üí JUST_COMMENT ‚Üí NO
- "What is Python?" (first message) ‚Üí INTRODUCE_TOPIC ‚Üí YES

Respond with ONLY a JSON object in this exact format:
{
  "intent": "<JUST_COMMENT|DEVELOP_TOPIC|INTRODUCE_TOPIC|CHANGE_TOPIC>",
  "shift": "<YES|NO>"
}

Gradient descent is an optimization algorithm used to minimize the loss 
function of a machine learning model by iteratively adjusting the model 
parameters. Here is an explanation of how gradient descent optimization 
works:

1. Initialization:
- Start by initializing the model parameters (weights and
