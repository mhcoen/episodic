ü§ñ DEBUG: Streaming modes - char: True, natural: False, constant: False
The vanishing gradient problem occurs during neural network training when 
gradients become extremely small as they propagate back through the network 
layers, leading to slow or halted learning in deep networks; this issue is 
often mitigated by using activation functions like ReLU that alleviate 
gradient
