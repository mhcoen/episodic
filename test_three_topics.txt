   Full prompt:
You are a topic-shift detection assistant.
You will receive the last n user messages and the current user message.
Your task: deduce whether the current message starts a new topic.

Preceding context:
- User: How do transformers differ from traditional RNNs?
- User: What's the purpose of dropout in neural networks?
- User: Tell me about convolutional neural networks
- User: What are some common activation functions and when to use them?
- User: How does backpropagation work in neural networks?

New message:
What are some best practices for training deep learning models?

Step 1. Classify intent as exactly one of:
- JUST_COMMENT: Brief acknowledgment, reaction, or filler that doesn't advance conversation
- DEVELOP_TOPIC: Continuing or expanding on the current topic
- INTRODUCE_TOPIC: Starting a conversation or first substantial message
- CHANGE_TOPIC: Shifting to a completely different subject

Step 2. Determine if this is a topic shift:
- INTRODUCE_TOPIC ‚Üí YES (starting fresh)
- CHANGE_TOPIC ‚Üí YES (new subject)
- DEVELOP_TOPIC ‚Üí NO (same topic)
- JUST_COMMENT ‚Üí NO (not substantial)

Examples:
- "Tell me more" ‚Üí DEVELOP_TOPIC ‚Üí NO
- "What about its moons?" (after Mars discussion) ‚Üí DEVELOP_TOPIC ‚Üí NO
- "How do I cook pasta?" (after Mars discussion) ‚Üí CHANGE_TOPIC ‚Üí YES
- "Thanks!" ‚Üí JUST_COMMENT ‚Üí NO
- "What is Python?" (first message) ‚Üí INTRODUCE_TOPIC ‚Üí YES

Training deep learning models effectively involves following several best 
practices to improve performance and efficiency. Here are some key best 
practices:

1. Data Preprocessing:
   - Normalize input data: Scale input features to a similar range to aid 
model convergence.

Gradient descent is an optimization algorithm commonly used in machine 
learning to minimize the loss function of a model during training. Here's a 
step-by-step explanation of gradient descent optimization:
