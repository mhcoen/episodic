# Topic Drift Detection Test Script 04 - Algorithm Comparison
# Tests different detection algorithms on the same conversation
# Run multiple times with different settings to compare
#
# First run: Sliding Window Detection (default)
# Second run: Hybrid Detection
# Third run: LLM-based Detection
#
# Configuration for testing
/init --erase
/set skip_llm_response true
/set debug true
/set show_drift true
/set show_topics true
/set topic-auto true

# Test which algorithm is currently active
/set use_sliding_window_detection
/set use_hybrid_topic_detection

# For comparing algorithms, run this script three times:
# 
# Run 1 - Sliding Window (default):
# /set use_sliding_window_detection true
# /set use_hybrid_topic_detection false
# 
# Run 2 - Hybrid Detection:
# /set use_sliding_window_detection false  
# /set use_hybrid_topic_detection true
#
# Run 3 - LLM Detection:
# /set use_sliding_window_detection false
# /set use_hybrid_topic_detection false
# /set skip_llm_response false  # Need LLM for this
#
# Compare:
# - Number of topics detected
# - Boundary placement accuracy
# - Detection confidence scores
# - Processing time
